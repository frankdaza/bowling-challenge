# BOWLING SOFTWARE
## By Frank Edward Daza Gonz√°lez

This repository contains the code of the Bowling challenge.
Just download the code with:

git clone https://github.com/frankdaza2/bowling-challenge.git

I used Java 8:

openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_222-b10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.222-b10, mixed mode).

For more information about how the software works, just watch the video called: Intro Execute Bowling Software, in the media folder.
